  <h1>Count Monkeys</h1>
  <p>You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your
    son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

    As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to
    and including that number, but excluding zero.

    For example, if n = 10:

    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</p>
  <br>
  <p>Open console for solution!</p>
  <script>
    let n = 10

    function monkeyCount(n) {
      let monkeyArray = []

      for (i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
        monkeyArray.push(i)
      }
      console.log(monkeyArray)
      return monkeyArray
    }


    monkeyCount(n)





  </script>
